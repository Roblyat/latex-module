    \section{Research Strategy}
    The literature search was organised around five content clusters $C_1,\dots,C_5$ and the goal/context term sets $C_{mt}$ and $C_{ct}$. 
    The clusters capture the main methodological families, while $C_{mt}$ and $C_{ct}$ constrain the queries to estimation-related objectives in robotic manipulation:

    \begin{itemize}
    \item $C_1  =$ Classical / Observers
    \item $C_2  =$ Gaussian Process (GP)
    \item $C_3  =$ Deep Sequence Models (MLP / GRU / TCN / Transformer / LSTM)
    \item $C_4  =$ Physics-Informed / Differentiable
    \item $C_5  =$ Surveys
    \item $C_T  =$ Goal \& Domain Terms
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $C_{mt} =$ Estimation \& Modeling Terms
        \item $C_{ct} =$ Robotics Context Terms
    \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

    The detailed index terms associated with each set are listed in 
    Appendix~\ref{app:query_categories}. For each content cluster $C_i$, a family of queries $Q_i$ was constructed by combining
    (disjunctions of) its index terms with estimation \& modelling terms from $C_{mt}$ and robotics context terms from $C_{ct}$.
    Figure~\ref{fig:query_logic} illustrates this logic schematically as a generalised set intersection over the three term groups.

    This process yielded 36 papers that are directly relevant to robot and payload dynamics, interaction force estimation and related identification problems.
    Table~\ref{tab:query-results} summarises how these works are distributed across the five query categories and counts, for each category, how many papers address payload dynamics, robot rigid-body dynamics,
    and contact-force estimation (papers that treat payload and rigid-body dynamics contribute to both columns); the corresponding relations are visualised in the concept graph in Fig.~\ref{fig:SoA_concept_graph}.

\section{Literature}\label{sec:literature}

\textbf{Category Q1} groups classical \emph{model-based methods for robot and payload dynamics and interaction force estimation}, mostly based on linearly parameterised rigid-body dynamics (RBD) and LS/WLS-type Newton-Euler regressors,
sometimes combined with observers and Kalman filters~\cite{Q1_1_fast_inertial_id_cobots,Q1_2_online_payload_mo,Q1_3_external_torque_smo,Q1_4_contact_force_kf,Q1_5_payload_estimation_compensation_2025,Q1_6_hu2025_fdrdi,Q1_7_10947736,Q1_8_10944553,Q1_9_xu2022_double_weighting_payload_id,Q1_10_duan_payload_ftsensor,Q1_12_han_finite_time_observer,Q1_13_dynamic_model_id_swevers2007,Q1_14_long2022sliding_momentum_observer,Q1_15_tang2023wls_rwspo,Q1_16_xu_payload_difference_2024,Q1_17_liu2021sensorless_dob_nn}.
Across these works, three main lines of research can be distinguished in payload dynamic parameter identification (PDPI) using force/torque (FT) sensing~\cite{Q1_1_fast_inertial_id_cobots,Q1_5_payload_estimation_compensation_2025,Q1_7_10947736,Q1_10_duan_payload_ftsensor},
robot and payload dynamic parameter identification in joint or motor-current space without FT sensors~\cite{Q1_6_hu2025_fdrdi,Q1_8_10944553,Q1_9_xu2022_double_weighting_payload_id,Q1_13_dynamic_model_id_swevers2007,Q1_15_tang2023wls_rwspo,Q1_16_xu_payload_difference_2024},
and observer-based sensorless force/torque estimation and online payload identification using proprioceptive data~\cite{Q1_3_external_torque_smo,Q1_4_contact_force_kf,Q1_12_han_finite_time_observer,Q1_14_long2022sliding_momentum_observer,Q1_17_liu2021sensorless_dob_nn,Q1_2_online_payload_mo}.  
Across Q1, mass is usually identified accurately, CoM moderately well, and inertia emerges as the hardest quantity to estimate robustly~\cite{Q1_1_fast_inertial_id_cobots,Q1_5_payload_estimation_compensation_2025,Q1_7_10947736,Q1_10_duan_payload_ftsensor,Q1_16_xu_payload_difference_2024}.

A first group of methods performs PDPI directly in the FT frame~\cite{Q1_1_fast_inertial_id_cobots,Q1_5_payload_estimation_compensation_2025,Q1_7_10947736,Q1_10_duan_payload_ftsensor}.
They typically exploit static poses to identify the payload mass and centre of mass, and then use dedicated dynamic excitation trajectories together with LS or TLS-type Newton-Euler regressors to estimate the inertia tensor.
Representative works demonstrate that, given a sufficiently informative excitation and an FT sensor rigidly mounted at the flange, payload mass can be recovered very accurately and CoM can be estimated with reasonable
precision, even for heavy payloads~\cite{Q1_1_fast_inertial_id_cobots,Q1_7_10947736}.  
However, inertia estimates are systematically more fragile---especially under cobot-typical safety constraints with short trajectories and low accelerations---and in several cases quantitative ground truth for CoM and inertia
is missing or only partially available (validation is often given in terms of residual gravitational/inertial wrench after compensation rather than direct parameter error)~\cite{Q1_1_fast_inertial_id_cobots,Q1_5_payload_estimation_compensation_2025,Q1_7_10947736,Q1_10_duan_payload_ftsensor}.  
Moreover, these approaches require additional FT hardware and considerable experimental effort in the form of carefully designed calibration motions.

A second group tackles robot dynamic parameter identification (RDPI) and PDPI in joint space or motor-current space without FT sensors~\cite{Q1_6_hu2025_fdrdi,Q1_8_10944553,Q1_9_xu2022_double_weighting_payload_id,Q1_13_dynamic_model_id_swevers2007,Q1_15_tang2023wls_rwspo,Q1_16_xu_payload_difference_2024}.  
Here, fully or partially decoupled identification schemes are designed to separate gravitational, frictional and inertial effects, often using families of S-curve or Fourier trajectories executed both with and without
payload~\cite{Q1_6_hu2025_fdrdi,Q1_8_10944553,Q1_9_xu2022_double_weighting_payload_id,Q1_13_dynamic_model_id_swevers2007}.  
Double-weighted WLS and optimisation-enhanced LS methods achieve very accurate joint-torque prediction and good agreement with CAD-based payload models, confirming that classical LS/NE pipelines---as systematised, for example, by Swevers et al.~\cite{Q1_13_dynamic_model_id_swevers2007}---remain a strong baseline
for RDPI and PDPI~\cite{Q1_6_hu2025_fdrdi,Q1_8_10944553,Q1_9_xu2022_double_weighting_payload_id,Q1_13_dynamic_model_id_swevers2007,Q1_15_tang2023wls_rwspo,Q1_16_xu_payload_difference_2024}.
At the same time, these methods are typically executed in dedicated calibration phases, rely on repeated execution of long and highly exciting trajectories and payload parameters are updated only between such identification
runs. They therefore provide an excellent commissioning tool and basis model, but do not by themselves endow the robot with continuous online awareness of payload changes during manipulation tasks.

A third line of work focuses on sensorless estimation of external joint torques and end-effector wrenches using observers and filters~\cite{Q1_3_external_torque_smo,Q1_4_contact_force_kf,Q1_12_han_finite_time_observer,Q1_14_long2022sliding_momentum_observer,Q1_17_liu2021sensorless_dob_nn}.
Momentum observers, higher-order sliding-mode observers, adaptive Kalman filters and high-order finite-time observers use a nominal RBD model together with controller torques and joint measurements to reconstruct external forces,
sometimes with probabilistic covariance information.  
These methods achieve good performance in collision detection, binary contact decisions and execution monitoring, and some approaches augment classical friction models with learned nonlinear terms such as neural-network
Stribeck approximations~\cite{Q1_3_external_torque_smo,Q1_14_long2022sliding_momentum_observer,Q1_17_liu2021sensorless_dob_nn}.
Nevertheless, their accuracy depends critically on the quality of the underlying RBD and friction models, and residual force errors remain significant in highly dynamic phases or around velocity reversals~\cite{Q1_3_external_torque_smo,Q1_12_han_finite_time_observer,Q1_17_liu2021sensorless_dob_nn}.
Importantly, most observer-based schemes treat payloads and tools as fixed parts of the nominal model or as lumped disturbances, and do not explicitly estimate payload parameters.

More recent contributions bridge RDPI/PDPI and observer-based estimation by using proprioceptive data to identify payload parameters online~\cite{Q1_2_online_payload_mo,Q1_16_xu_payload_difference_2024}.
Momentum-observer-based schemes and parameter-difference methods compute external joint torques as residuals between measured and model-based torques and apply LS/RLS Newton-Euler regressors to recover payload mass, CoM and,
in some cases, inertia during regular robot operation.  
These works demonstrate that accurate online PDPI is possible without FT sensors, provided that a reasonably accurate base robot model, friction compensation and sufficiently exciting motions are available~\cite{Q1_2_online_payload_mo,Q1_16_xu_payload_difference_2024}.
At the same time, they underline several structural limitations: inertia remains the hardest quantity to identify robustly; nonlinear friction, backlash and transmission effects must be modelled or learned carefully (with several authors explicitly noting residual error peaks near motion reversal due to unmodelled friction~\cite{Q1_13_dynamic_model_id_swevers2007,Q1_15_tang2023wls_rwspo});
and the resulting estimators not providing a unified, continuously updated representation of robot and load.

Taken together, the Q1 literature shows that classical model-based techniques can deliver high-quality RDPI and PDPI, as well as useful sensorless interaction-force estimates, but typically only under carefully
controlled excitation of dedicated identification trajectories~\cite{Q1_1_fast_inertial_id_cobots,Q1_5_payload_estimation_compensation_2025,Q1_6_hu2025_fdrdi,Q1_7_10947736,Q1_8_10944553,Q1_9_xu2022_double_weighting_payload_id,Q1_12_han_finite_time_observer,Q1_13_dynamic_model_id_swevers2007,Q1_15_tang2023wls_rwspo,Q1_16_xu_payload_difference_2024,Q1_17_liu2021sensorless_dob_nn}.
From the perspective of this work, the main gaps are the lack of a unified, online notion of dynamic awareness that covers robot and payload; the persistent difficulty of reliably identifying and exploiting
payload inertia in cobot-safe regimes; and the sensitivity of existing approaches to friction and transmission nonlinearities. [REFERENCES HERE!]

\textbf{Category Q2} groups \emph{Gaussian Process (GP) and GP-hybrid methods for inverse dynamics and sensorless contact estimation}. 
In all cases, a GP is trained offline as a residual or surrogate model on top of a nominal rigid-body dynamics (RBD) description, and then deployed online for torque or disturbance prediction
~\cite{Q2_1_contact_force_gp_observer,Q2_3_contact_detection_gp}

Two studies use GPs to improve joint-space contact-force estimation.
In~\cite{Q2_1_contact_force_gp_observer}, an enhanced GP learns the residual dynamics between an Euler-Lagrange model and measured torques; this residual is injected into a decoupling disturbance observer and Kalman filter
to obtain external joint torques and end-effector forces.  
The follow-up~\cite{Q2_2_contact_force_gpadkf} extends this to a GP-adaptive disturbance Kalman filter, where the disturbance covariance is adjusted based on the GP output.
Both papers show reduced estimation error and faster convergence than purely model-based observers, but require a reasonably accurate nominal model, high-quality proprioception and extensive non-contact training data;
payload and tool effects are absorbed into a single residual term.

A third work combines GP inverse dynamics with learning-based contact detection~\cite{Q2_3_contact_detection_gp}.
A GP predicts non-contact motor torques from joint states, and the residual between measured and GP-predicted torques is passed to a convolutional neural network that classifies contact vs.\ no-contact during assembly tasks,
achieving high classification accuracy on scripted collisions.  
The method remains task-specific and does not recover physical interaction forces or payload parameters.

Finally,~\cite{Q2_4_GIACOMUZZO20231584} compares GPs and neural networks for inverse dynamics when the inputs include physics-inspired features (e.g.\ nominal RBD torques).  
Embedding such structure improves data efficiency and prediction accuracy and GPs are competitive for moderate dataset sizes.

Overall, Q2 shows that GPs are effective residual models for unmodelled robot dynamics and can enhance sensorless contact estimation
~\cite{Q2_1_contact_force_gp_observer,Q2_2_contact_force_gpadkf,Q2_3_contact_detection_gp,Q2_4_GIACOMUZZO20231584}.
However, the GP is always a lumped compensator: there is no sequence-aware handling of backlash or history-dependent friction,
and no unified dynamic representation in the measurement frame that could serve as a precise, task-agnostic basis for tool/gripper compensation.

\textbf{Category Q3} comprises deep-learning approaches for inverse dynamics, force estimation and payload identification.  
Most methods either learn residual dynamics on top of a nominal rigid-body model or learn a direct mapping from joint histories to payload parameters or contact indicators, using LSTM/GRU-type sequence models, feed-forward
networks, CNNs or ensemble methods~\cite{Q3_1_tao_bll,Q3_2_encoder_attention_payload,Q3_3_lstm_force_estimation,Q3_4_asgrnn_force_observer,Q3_5_contact_localization_cnn,Q3_6_payload_id_incremental_ensemble,Q3_7_payload_id_online_ensemble,Q3_8_payload_id_catastrophic_forgetting}.

A first group focuses on \emph{deep residual inverse dynamics} on top of a nominal RBD model.  
In~\cite{Q3_1_tao_bll}, the authors use the public Franka Panda dataset and the Gaz et al.\ model to compute joint-torque residuals between data and RBD prediction, and train a bootstrapped
LSTM ensemble (BLL-LSTM) on sequences of $(q,\dot q,\ddot q)$ to predict these residuals.  
The ensemble clearly improves torque prediction over Gaussian processes and single models on held-out dataset splits, but remains a purely offline, dataset-based study that assumes a reasonably accurate full robot model.  
Similarly,~\cite{Q3_3_lstm_force_estimation} trains LSTMs to map base FT-wrench and joint states to end-effector tip forces, and joint states to joint torques, on a 7-DoF Panda.  
The LSTMs outperform MLPs, 1D convolutions and a DeLaN baseline in both simulation and real experiments, but are evaluated in a task-specific setting and rely on FT hardware and simulation-generated ground-truth forces.

A second group uses deep models to infer end-effector wrench or contact directly from proprioception.  
The adaptive sparse GRNN force observer in~\cite{Q3_4_asgrnn_force_observer} maps joint positions, velocities, accelerations and motor currents to 6D wrench on a UR5 teleoperation system, using an FT sensor only for
supervision; it achieves strong soft/stiff collision force estimation and outperforms GP and MLP baselines.  
In~\cite{Q3_5_contact_localization_cnn}, a CNN is trained in IsaacGym with domain randomisation to detect and localise link-environment contacts for a 7-DoF Panda using only link velocities and pose errors
(no torque or FT sensing). The network reaches around 98\,\% accuracy in sim-to-real contact localisation, but does not estimate wrench magnitude or payload dynamics.

The third line of work addresses \emph{payload dynamic parameter identification (PDPI)} with deep networks and ensembles.  
A learning-based method for the OpenMANIPULATOR-X in~\cite{Q3_2_encoder_attention_payload} combines a nominal RBD model and camera pose estimation with an MLP that processes joint states and velocity sign to estimate
per-joint torque contributions; a subsequent LS step recovers payload mass and CoM of known objects, with average errors of about 9\,\% in mass and 18\,\% in CoM.  
For collaborative cobots,\cite{Q3_7_payload_id_online_ensemble} proposes a batch ensemble of weak learners (NNs or decision trees) that directly map $(q,\dot q,\tau)$ to payload parameters for a library of 77 payloads along
a fixed excitation trajectory on a Franka robot; the method achieves good sim-to-real transfer and clearly reduces mass/CoM error compared to RLS, but still requires a dedicated excitation path per payload.  
This is generalised in~\cite{Q3_6_payload_id_incremental_ensemble,Q3_8_payload_id_catastrophic_forgetting}, which introduce incremental ensemble learning for PDPI along arbitrary task paths.  
The initial incremental ensemble~\cite{Q3_6_payload_id_incremental_ensemble} adapts weak learners online based on Euclidean distance in feature space but suffers from catastrophic forgetting on previously seen trajectories.  
The follow-up work~\cite{Q3_8_payload_id_catastrophic_forgetting} adds a bag-based classifier that routes new path segments to the most relevant weak learner and spawns new learners as required, thereby preserving accuracy
on old paths while adapting to new ones and eliminating the explicit excitation trajectory.  
The price is a growing ensemble size and the fact that the individual learners remain small feed-forward networks without explicit temporal structure.

Overall, the Q3 literature shows that deep models can substantially improve torque and force estimation and can achieve competitive PDPI, including sim-to-real transfer for collaborative robots.  
At the same time, existing works either depend on accurate nominal models and FT supervision, or operate as largely black-box payload regressors, and none provide a unified deep sequence model that simultaneously
delivers joint-torque prediction, tool/payload compensation and interaction-force awareness during general manipulation tasks.

\textbf{Category Q4} groups \emph{physics-informed and differentiable dynamics models}, where deep networks are structured by Lagrangian or state-space physics and trained on joint data to predict torques or currents.
The central goal in all works is accurate \emph{robot dynamic parameter identification (RDPI)} and inverse dynamics prediction for fixed robots; payload dynamics and interaction forces are not estimated explicitly.

A first line of work builds on Deep Lagrangian Networks (DeLaN) and related continuous-time models. The survey and benchmark in~\cite{Q4_2_lutter2023combiningphysicsdeeplearning} compares structured DeLaN/HNN models against
black-box neural networks on low-DoF systems and a 4-DoF WAM arm, showing that physics-informed architectures achieve lower normalised errors and much longer valid prediction horizons than unconstrained networks. However,
these models assume conservative dynamics without contacts, and friction is either neglected or handled separately. Extending this idea,~\cite{Q4_1_extended_delan_motor} learns an ``extended DeLaN'' that incorporates motor
couplings and friction on a UR10e arm, using joint positions, velocities and accelerations together with motor currents. The network learns Lagrangian terms plus actuator/friction parameters and predicts motor currents with
high accuracy in simulation and on hardware, outperforming the original DeLaN and a feed-forward baseline, yet still under fixed tool/payload and contact-free conditions.

A second line of work uses physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) as refinements of classical LS/NE identification. In~\cite{Q4_3_residual_pinns_dynamics_id}, base parameters are first obtained by a Newton-Euler regressor;
a decomposed PINN then minimises a hybrid loss combining data residuals and the rigid-body dynamics equations, reducing joint-torque RMSE compared to LS alone. Building on this,~\cite{Q4_4_10729277}
proposes a friction-inclusive PINN for multi-joint industrial robots without joint torque sensors, combining Lagrangian dynamics with an explicit Stribeck friction model and a history-based residual network that learns
remaining errors over a time window. The resulting hybrid model achieves very strong joint-torque (or current) prediction across several joints and outperforms DeLaN-type and LS baselines. Finally,~\cite{Q4_5_10305255}
introduces an H-PINN for a single collaborative robot joint, embedding the joint's state-space dynamics into an RNN cell and jointly estimating physical parameters and state transitions, with highly accurate joint-level
dynamics prediction in simulation and experiments.

Across Q4, physics-informed deep models consistently improve inverse-dynamics prediction and friction compensation compared to purely black-box networks, while using only encoder and motor data~\cite{Q4_1_extended_delan_motor,Q4_2_lutter2023combiningphysicsdeeplearning,Q4_3_residual_pinns_dynamics_id,Q4_4_10729277,Q4_5_10305255}.
At the same time, they are trained on carefully designed excitation trajectories and then deployed as fixed models, without explicit treatment of changing payloads or contact forces, and some architectures become quite
complex when scaling beyond low-DoF setups or single joints.
Thus, Q4 provides strong structured baselines for fixed robot dynamics, but does not yet realise an online, unified dynamic awareness of robot, tool and payload with explicit force estimation, as targeted in this work.
