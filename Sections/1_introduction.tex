    \item What is the technical problem? A combination of the following:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item No persistent memory
        \item Not Real-Time
        \item 3D-Representation
        \item Sensibility to false positives for zero shot object detection
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Scientific Contribution:
        This work contributes to the state-of-the-art by introducing a hybrid semantic exploration framework that combines open-vocabulary frontier scoring~\cite{yokoyama2024vlfm} with global semantic 3D scene representation~\cite{kashu2023openfusion}, enabling multi-object search with open-vocabulary queries (text\sout{, image, audio}) during autonomous exploration. The proposed method is evaluated for improvements in multi-object \ac{SR} as well as path efficiency measured by \ac{SPL}.This is achieved by streamlining existing frontier scoring systems that selectively choose expert models based on the current tasks into a singular vision-language model based on \ac{SEEM}~\cite{zou2023seem}, substantially reducing GPU memory requirements compared to traditional semantic exploration pipelines using multiple separate models. Exploration is complemented by a sensor-based fusion strategy that integrates semantic detections from \ac{SEEM}~\cite{zou2023seem} with clustered relevance fields from semantic 3D mapping~\cite{kashu2023openfusion}, applying spatial confidence weighting to enhance robustness against false positives in zero-shot object detection. Experimental validation of the proposed system on a real mobile robot, focusing on practical aspects such as real-time performance and robustness to sensor noise including depth inaccuracies and changing lighting conditions.
